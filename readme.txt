== Description ==

This is a very simple and lightweight Plugin for rating authors by visitors.

It allows the visitors to rate an author of a post, if they like any. On installation Average rating stars, "Want to 'Rate this Author?" button and list of approved visitors(who viewed that author) is shown up automatically.

On clicking "Want to 'Rate this Author?" button a popup form populates in the lightbox. A visitor can fill the required information i.e.:-

1. Name
2. Email
3. City
4. Visitor's own profile image
5. Rating stars(Choose how many stars you want to give this author)
6. Comments.

and submit it.

On submission it goes in admin. An admin has access to all the reviews. Here he can either approve or delete a review.

An author also has access to review list but he can approve or delete only those reviews which were rated to him.

An admin can also change default error and success message in Admin -> Rate this Author -> Settings.
